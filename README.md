# Schmitz_Gehirn
Hive mind intended for navigating and mapping 2D spaces.

## About
This whole project is dedicated to a simple idea behind genetic algorithms. Mainly: how to optimize for fuzzy, independent, parameters to obtain a useful, transferable model.

The objective for the project is to make a system that can map a real world environment and navigate it. 
At this point, we as developers want to bring that system to work in a highly restricted manner in the form of our simulation, where all of the actuators, energy consumption, and time delays are incapsulated within a simple world where the object in question is a few lines of code, and his interaction with the world is reduced to calling functions.



Additional Info:
	The graphics of the simulation are provided using the engine from 'Tetris' reposetory, but some parts of the implementation might differ due to unsynchronized nature of development of these projects. 
	
	
> The name of the projects stemms from the German word Gehirn meaning Brain or Mind, and Schmitz refering to "James H. Schmitz who was the first person to dub a collective alien intelligence a __*hive mind*__"
